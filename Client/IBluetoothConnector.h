/*
General notes: Please look at the implementation of WindowsBluetoothConnector.
* Functions should throw RecoverableExceptions if they're indeed recoverable, and throw std::runtime_error otherwise.
* RecoverableException can force a disconnection of the socket with an additional param (a call to disconnect()).
* connect() should try the v1 service UUID (SONY_UUID) first and fall back to the v2 UUID (SONY_UUID_V2)
* if no v1 SDP service record is found, recording which one succeeded for getProtocolVersion().
* See notes below
